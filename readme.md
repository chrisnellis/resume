This repo generates my resume website and PDF using [HackMyResume](https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume). For my website, I use a slightly modified [Mocha Responsive theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-mocha-responsive), and for the PDF, I use a slightly modified [onepage theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-onepage)

I use Github's Workflow to update my PDF and Webpage on changes to the `resume.json` file in the `src` folder.
