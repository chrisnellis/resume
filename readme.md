This repo generates my resume by using [HackMyResume](https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume), and uses a slightly customized copy of the [jsonresume Flat theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-flat).

Github's CI tracks changes and builds the resume files whenever the source document changes.
