    "brief": "As a software engineer, I love solving problems with well-architected and well-tested software using test driven development and paired programming. I prefer the back end of the stack, and feel most comfortable Springing into action writing microservices. Automating mundane processes is a hobby of mine, like the creation of [this very document](https://github.com/chrisnellis/resume)!"
