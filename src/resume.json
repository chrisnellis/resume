    "brief": "I love solving problems with well-architected and well-tested software. I'm a firm believer in test driven development as well as paired programming. I prefer the back end of the stack, and feel most comfortable Springing into action writing microservices. I also enjoy automating mundane processes, like the creation of [this very document](https://github.com/chrisnellis/resume)!"
